Authors@R: person("Marc", "Paterno", email = "paterno@fnal.gov", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The art framework's TimeTracker service can write
    an SQLite database containing event-by-event and module-by-module
    execution times. The artsupport package provides functions to
    enable (and I hope make easy) analysis of these data.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.3.2),
    dplyr,
    tidyr,
    RSQLite
